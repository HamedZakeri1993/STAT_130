    "### Overview of the Monty Hall Problem:\n",
    "Imagine you're on a game show, and you're asked to choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats. After you choose a door, the host (Monty) will open one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat. You are then given the option to **stay** with your original choice or **switch** to the other unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterintuitive result is that you're more likely to win if you **switch** (your probability of winning by switching is 2/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's walk through the code step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Importing Libraries and Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple representing three doors (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "my_door_choice = 1  # You always start by choosing door 1\n",
    "i_won = 0  # Count of how many times you win by switching doors\n",
    "reps = 100000  # Number of times to repeat the simulation (100,000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`all_door_options`**: This is a tuple that represents the three doors available to choose from (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "- **`my_door_choice`**: You initially always pick door 1.\n",
    "- **`i_won`**: This variable keeps track of how many times you win by switching doors.\n",
    "- **`reps`**: The number of repetitions for the simulation (100,000 times in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Running the Simulation Multiple Times\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(reps):\n",
    "    secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)  # Randomly pick the winning door\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This loop runs the simulation 100,000 times (`reps = 100000`).\n",
    "- For each iteration, the game randomly selects which door hides the car (`secret_winning_door`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Removing Doors to Simulate Monty Hall's Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)  # Convert tuple to list to remove doors\n",
    "    all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)  # Remove the winning door\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Convert the tuple of doors into a list so that we can modify it (remove doors).\n",
    "- Remove the door with the car (`secret_winning_door`) because Monty won't reveal the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Remove Player‚Äôs Initial Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)  # Remove the player's initial choice\n",
    "    except:\n",
    "        pass  # Ignore errors if the player's choice is already removed\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the player's initial choice is the same as the winning door, we remove it from the list.\n",
    "- The `try` block handles the case where the player's choice was already removed (if they picked the winning door initially).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Monty Reveals a Goat Door\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)  # Monty reveals a goat\n",
    "    all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)  # Remove the goat door from the list\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Monty randomly selects one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat (`goat_door_reveal`).\n",
    "- That goat door is then removed from the list, leaving only the player's choice and one other door.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Player Switches to the Remaining Door\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:\n",
    "        all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)  # Add back the winning door if needed\n",
    "    my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]  # Player switches to the remaining door\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the player's original choice wasn't the winning door, we add the winning door back to the list.\n",
    "- The player then switches to the only remaining door (`my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Check if Player Wins\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:\n",
    "        i_won += 1  # Increment the win counter if the player wins\n",
    "```\n",
    "- After switching, if the player's new door is the winning door, they win, and `i_won` is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Calculate the Win Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i_won / reps  # Calculate the win percentage by dividing wins by the total repetitions\n",
    "```\n",
    "- At the end, the win rate is calculated by dividing the number of wins (`i_won`) by the total number of simulations (`reps`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The player always chooses door 1.\n",
    "2. The winning door is randomly chosen.\n",
    "3. Monty reveals a losing (goat) door.\n",
    "4. The player switches to the remaining door.\n",
    "5. If the new door is the winning door, the player wins.\n",
    "6. This is repeated 100,000 times to estimate the probability of winning by switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result (`i_won / reps`) will show that switching doors leads to a win around 66.6% of the time, which aligns with the Monty Hall problem's solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this step-by-step explanation makes the code easier to follow!"
